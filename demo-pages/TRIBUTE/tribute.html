    <figcaption  id="img-caption" ><br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp One year ago, the world stopped as news circulated of a helicopter crash outside of Los Angeles that killed Lakers great Kobe Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, and seven others.

        Sports commentators cried on live television. Fans and mourners descended upon Staples Center. NBA teams took 24-second shot-clock  violations in honor of his number.
        
        In the year since, a pandemic arrived, protests started over racial injustice and a new president was inaugurated. But even amid so much change, people are taking time to remember the lives lost on a hillside in Calabasas.</figcaption>
