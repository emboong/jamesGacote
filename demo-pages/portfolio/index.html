        <a href="">Hi there, my name is</a>
        <h1>JAMES GACOTE</h1>
        <p>a future programmer that will make the world much easier and comfortable when it comes to technology. 
            <br> This is my simple portfolio and I just simply showcase my web developing skills as of now<br>
             and will do my best to improve and get more skills throughout the session that will be having.<br>
              As of now, my outputs are not that amazing and jaw dropping but I believe in small progress is a process.<br>
              Life is full of surprises and with effort and determination, we will all be able to achieve what is
              <br> on our minds. Dreams do come true if we believe in ourself. Programming is not easy, it is like we
              <br>are mixing chemicals too but we all will be there at the top having our own dreams. Life is like a river, <br>
            let it flow and wait where will it bring you, trust the process, be humble and kind, mind your own business and let
               <br>other talk and talk. Remember, it is yourself who can levitate you and it is them who will drag you down so think wisely.</p>
